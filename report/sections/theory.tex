The Ising Model is a discrete mathematical model of ferromagnetism. The model consists of a 2 dimensional lattice of which we arrange particles with nuclear magnetic moments (spin) Each individual spin $s_i$ has only two possible states: $s_i=-1$ and $s_i=+1$. The total energy of the system is described by the equation
\begin{equation}
    E(\mathbf{s})=-J \sum_{\langle k l\rangle}^N s_k s_l.
\end{equation}
Here $\langle k l\rangle$ denotes each pair of neighbouring spins. The constant $J$ sets the energy associated with each such interaction. The model is particularly good for investigating phase transitions.
